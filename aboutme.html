            <p>
                Started my professional journey when I was 18 years old as a full-time student and computer technician. 
                I worked at a computer repair shop troubleshooting and repairing desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and video game consoles. 
                <br><br>

                After a few years of working at a computer repair shop, I applied to Year Up Bay Area and became enrolled. 
                Year Up was an interesting 12-month journey as I spent six months training in personal development and went down the Cyber Security path. 
                After the six months, I was awarded a six-month internship at Yammer as an IT Technician, a subsidiary of Microsoft. 
                My takeaways from this experience were: day-to-day life as a person working in tech in an office, the discourse among tech workers, 
                assimilating as a professional IT technician at a tech office, and qualities to have when working on a team. 
                <br><br>

                After Year Up, I was hired as a contractor for a role as an Associate IT Technician at Fitbit. 
                My takeaways from this experience were: managing IT support tickets, even more experience working on a team, the importance of speaking up, 
                work/life balance, and what I want from the tech industry in exchange for my talents and skills. 
                <br><br>

                Even through Year Up and Fitbit, I was still enrolled in school. 
                I love learning and I love surrounding myself with experts, especially the ones who are actual enthusiasts for computers.
                I consider my degrees and credentials as some of my greatest accomplishments in life because I earned them through hard effort and disciplined knowledge. 
                I think even when I am old and I retire, I will still find myself registering to classes because learning and being part of a learning group is something I enjoy. 
                <br><br>

                After working as a technician, I am learning, training, practicing, working, and fully focused on computer science. 
                I pivoted because I feel like I have accomplished all of my goals as a computer technician and as a curious individual, 
                I want to expand my reach in the world of computer technology. I am experienced with many programming languages and concepts. 
                However, I never forgotten my roots as a computer technician. I love computers and technology, 
                and I want to work with people to accomplish goals and help others with my talents.
